# Password Replacer

An AutoHotkey utility that allows you to quickly insert a stored password using a simple hotstring.

## ⚠️ Security Warning

**IMPORTANT:** This script stores passwords in **plaintext** in an INI file. This is **not secure** for sensitive passwords. Only use this for:
- Testing/Development passwords
- Non-critical accounts
- Local machine only

**DO NOT use for:**
- Banking passwords
- Email account passwords
- Administrative credentials
- Any production system passwords

For better security, consider using dedicated password managers like 1Password, Bitwarden, or KeePass.

## Features
- Simple hotstring-based password insertion: Type `mpass` + Enter
- Set/update passwords with `setpass` hotstring
- Passwords stored in `PRSettings.ini` file
- Works in any application that accepts text input
- Lightweight and unobtrusive

## Requirements
- AutoHotkey v1.1 or later
- Windows operating system

## Installation
1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download `PasswordReplacer.ahk`
3. Run the script by double-clicking it
4. The script runs silently in the background

## Usage

### Setting Your Password
1. Type `setpass` and press Enter
2. A dialog box will appear asking for your password
3. Enter your password (it will be hidden)
4. Press OK
5. You'll see a confirmation message

### Using Your Password
1. In any text field, type `mpass` and press Enter
2. Your stored password will be automatically inserted
3. The password is inserted as if you typed it

## Files
- `PasswordReplacer.ahk` - Main script file
- `PRSettings.ini` - Configuration file (created automatically)

## Configuration
You can edit `PRSettings.ini` manually if needed:
```ini
[settings]
ww=yourpasswordhere
```

## How It Works
The script:
1. Checks if `PRSettings.ini` exists
2. Stores passwords in the `[settings]` section under key `ww`
3. Retrieves passwords when `mpass` hotstring is triggered
4. Uses `SendInput` to type the password into the active window

## Troubleshooting

### "No password saved" error
- This means the script hasn't been run with `setpass` yet
- Type `setpass` and Enter to create your first password

### Password not inserting
- Make sure you're in a text input field
- The script must be running (check AutoHotkey icon in system tray)
- Some applications may block automated input; try using the clipboard instead

### Password file not found
- The `PRSettings.ini` file should be in the same directory as the script
- Recreate it by running `setpass` hotstring

## Hotstrings Reference
| Hotstring | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `setpass` | Open dialog to set/update password |
| `mpass` | Insert stored password |

## Limitations
- Passwords stored in plaintext (security risk)
- Only one password can be stored
- No password encryption
- Requires AutoHotkey to be running
- Some applications may block automated text input

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Add password encryption using Windows DPAPI
- [ ] Support multiple passwords with labels
- [ ] Add password strength validation
- [ ] Implement master password protection
- [ ] Add clipboard-based password insertion option
- [ ] Create Windows exe wrapper for easier distribution
